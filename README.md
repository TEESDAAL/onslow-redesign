# onslow-redesign
A server side redesign of the old Onslow website

## Seeing the design
Since this website has some logic that has to be run server side this has to be run via localhost
1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/TEESDAAL/onslow-redesign`
2. `cd` into the repository then install the npm packages using `npm install`
3. The website can then be seen using `npm run dev` and then clicking the provided localhost url

## Please note this will not work if npm is not installed!
